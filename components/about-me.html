    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Hi I'm Charles Nguyen, a Full-Stack Developer. I graduated from San Jose State University, San
      Jose, in 2022 with a degree in Applied Computational Mathematics and focus in Software Programming. I am
      currently improving myself by taking Full-Stack Developer bootcamp at the University of California, Berkeley. <br /><br />
      I enjoy building dynamic, creative products from start to finish. Focus on developing intuitive experiences that
      constantly grow and improve based on user metrics.
